# Vehicle Navigation Automation with Java Selenium

This project aims to automate the navigation of a vehicle by changing coordinates using Java with Selenium WebDriver. The automation script simulates the movement of a vehicle by interacting with a web interface and updating its coordinates accordingly.

## Prerequisites

Before running the automation script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Selenium WebDriver
- WebDriver for your preferred browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome)
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone
```

2. Import the project into your IDE.

3. Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser and place it in the project directory.

4. Update the WebDriver path in the automation script (`VehicleNavigationTest.java`) to point to the location of the WebDriver executable.

## Usage

1. Open the project in your IDE.

2. Navigate to the `src` directory and locate `VehicleNavigationTest.java`.

3. Modify the coordinates or other parameters as needed for your navigation scenario.

4. Run the `VehicleNavigationTest.java` file as a Java application.

5. Sit back and watch as the vehicle navigates by updating its coordinates automatically.
